# Spots for Rocks

A [website](http://spotsfor.rocks) for finding the perfect place to bring your Pet Rock.

---

This is a side project that I am creating to help me learn and understand how to build a full-stack web application.

The stack that I will be using is the MEN (Mongo, Express, Node) stack. In addition, I will also be using ReSTful routes and api to build the application.

The website is hosted on AWS Elastic BeanStalk with a Route 53 domain

Lastly, I am also using Bootstrap 4 and a template engine called EJS to style the site.
